Quick TODO:

- Most important to gameplay right now is the fact that there is no proper solution-checking. Instead I have a single hard-coded solution for each level just as a stand-in. Need to flesh out an algorithm to check that there is a path from start to finish, and that the entirety of the path has no leaks (a leak being that an open end of a pipe does not face the open end of another pipe).
- Also, for future level development, it would be nice to create a level-generator instead of fleshing them out by hand.
- ALSO: Clean out old comments/TODOs from scripts, and move reused code elements like TileType into separate files.
